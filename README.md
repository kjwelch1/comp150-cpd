# comp150-cpd

Week 1 – the first challenge I faced was when we were asked to organise ourselves into groups for the Lego robot Olympics, the issue was that I knew no one, to overcome this you must force yourself to interact with others this is good for later in life when getting a job in a computer industry or working for a client.
Week 2 – the main challenge I faced this week was pitching our game concepts, the issue is with my confidence of speaking, to overcome this you could make and a learn a script to help take stress off from the rest of the public speaking.
Week 3 – what I struggled most with this week was getting my head around agile and specifically using task boards correctly, we incorrectly used the wrong headers for our game concept, to overcome this we communicated with our peers and looked at the lecture slides to correct our mistake.
Week 4 – this week I my main issue was logic gates, struggled when trying to make logic circuits, to overcome this I spent time outside of the lecture researching and looking at logic circuit demos to try and understand how they work.
Week 5 – on this week I really struggled with algorithm complexities, specifically the big o notation, to overcome this spent many hours discussing and researching with peers.
Week 6 – getting to use latex I found rather challenging to use, I could not get the software run the document I had wrote, I spent a lot of time researching the issue and found the issue was due to referencing and bibTex.
Week 7 – comp 120 peer review struggled with getting a viable picture manipulation program to work in time, my time management for making, to improve you would organise time and plan when doing what work.
Week 8 – comp 120 audios didn’t manage to get the initial demo to work, so struggled throughout lecture as they moved through different tasks and improving the demo, to solve this could have made better notes to go back to that would help with me improving my code.
Week 9 – I struggled with machine code this week, specifically worksheet e and calculating the factorials, I had to research into how factorials work and the raw basics of how while or if statements work so I could implement them in the raw form of programming.
Week 10 – Essay peer review struggled with writing the essay on time, I didn’t manage my time appropriately to produce enough work for a peer review, to improve this I would organise my time and split the work up over small sessions.
Week 11 – I found mathematics for computing professions very hard, with specifically mantissa and exponents, this takes allot of thinking meaning I need to do further reading and research into the maths behind it.
Week 12 – I struggled this week with all the deadlines and getting the work done to a high standard, specifically getting my comp 120 tinkering audio, to improve this I will get the raw program finished earlier and then have time to improve before the deadline.
